The following files will be copied to here:
cuboids.json
unsquished.json

The following file will need to be generated by SpiralOpt and then copied here:
coords.son

The above three files will be needed by SpiralViz (in Unreal Engine - the renderer).
Currently, they need manually copying to:
C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.2\Engine\Binaries\Win64\
